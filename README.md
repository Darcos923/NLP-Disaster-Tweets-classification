# NLP-Disaster-Tweets-classification

ðŸŽ¯ The aim of this lab/notebook is to carry out an analysis and comparison of different predictive models to determine whether a tweet talks about a natural disaster (labelled with a 1) or not (labelled with a 0 in this case).

To do so, we will have a database for training and another one for testing.

The variables in datasets are the next:

*   id --> a unique identifier for each tweet
*   text --> the text of the tweet
*   location --> the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
*   keyword --> a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
*   target --> in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
